# myBlockChain
Testing BlockChain principles with JS. 
// To run this network using different computers copy the entire project and run it sharing the same Wi-fi network and replacing 'localhost' address with IP-address:'node#'. 
// No error handling has been made as the focus of the project was only to get to know basic principles of blockchain technology using JS. 
// Next possible improvements: Founds verification from the sender when making transactions, add data types to store inside of each block and use that data when generating block hash.
