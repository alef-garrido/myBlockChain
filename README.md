# myBlockChain
Testing BlockChain principles with JS. 
// To run this network using different computers copy entire project and run it using same Wi-fi network and replacing 'localhost' address with IP-address:'node#'
//No error handling has been made as the focus of the project was to get to know basic principles of blockchain technology
//Next possible improvements: Founds verification from sender when making transactions, add data types to store inside of each block and use that data when generating blockHash.
